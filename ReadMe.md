### LearnGL
This repository is just a personal project that I have created to try to learn how OpenGL works, I'm following tutorials from learnopengl.com.

### Operating System

My operating system is Windows 10, I don't have plans to use linux at the moment, maybe in the future.

### Resources/Libraries
To create/build the whole project, I'm using:
- CMake to structure the project
- GLFW to create the main window and handle user inputs
- GLEW to access OpenGL functions
